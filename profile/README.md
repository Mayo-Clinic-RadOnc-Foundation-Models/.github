# Mayo-UGA RadOnc Foundation Models

Welcome to the Mayo-UGA RadOnc Foundation Models GitHub organization! Our mission is to advance the field of Radiation Oncology through the innovative application of Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning Models (LMMs), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our repositories are dedicated to developing, evaluating, and applying cutting-edge technologies to improve patient care in Radiation Oncology and Radiology.

## Our Projects

- **Mayo-UGA RadOnc Foundation Models**: A repository for foundational LLMs and LMMs dedicated to Radiation Oncology.
- **Radiology-NLI Public**: Exploring trade-offs between unified large language models and local fine-tuned models for specific radiology NLI tasks.
- **Tailoring Large Language Models to Radiology**: Initial approaches for adapting LLMs to the highly specialized domain of radiology.
- **Artificial Intelligence-Facilitated Online Adaptive Proton Therapy**: Utilizing AI and pencil beam scanning proton therapy for adaptive treatment.
- **Holistic Evaluation of GPT-4v for Biomedical Imaging**: Comprehensive assessments of GPT-4v's capabilities in biomedical imaging contexts.
- **Beam Mask and Sliding Window Dose Prediction**: Implementing deep learning for accurate and efficient dose prediction in proton therapy.
- **Patient-Specific 3D CT Images Reconstruction**: Vision transformer-based deep learning for reconstructing 3D CT images from 2D KV images.
- **Deep Learning-Based 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer**: Fast and accurate deep learning methods for 3D CT image registration in lung cancer treatment.
- **Clinicalradiobert**: Few-shot learning and knowledge infusion for clinical notes named entity recognition.
- **Evaluating LLMs on Radiation Oncology Physics**: Assessing the performance of LLMs on specialized topics within radiation oncology physics.
- **SAMAug & Segment Anything Model for Radiation Oncology**: Innovations in model segmentation and augmentation for radiation oncology applications.
- **LLM for AAPM TG-263 Report**: Benchmarking LLMs on structuring names in compliance with AAPM TG-263.
- **Radiation Oncology NLP Database**: Establishing a comprehensive NLP database for radiation oncology.
