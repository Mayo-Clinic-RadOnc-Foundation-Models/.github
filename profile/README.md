# Mayo-UGA RadOnc Foundation Models

Welcome to the Mayo-UGA RadOnc Foundation Models GitHub organization! Our mission is to advance the field of Radiation Oncology through the innovative application of Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning Models (LMMs), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our repositories are dedicated to developing, evaluating, and applying cutting-edge technologies to improve patient care in Radiation Oncology and Radiology.

## Our Projects

- **Radiology-NLI Public**: Exploring trade-offs between unified large language models and local fine-tuned models for specific radiology NLI tasks.
- **Holistic Evaluation of GPT-4v for Biomedical Imaging**: Comprehensive assessments of GPT-4v's capabilities in biomedical imaging contexts.
- **Beam Mask and Sliding Window Dose Prediction**: Implementing deep learning for accurate and efficient dose prediction in proton therapy.
- **Deep Learning-Based 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer**: Fast and accurate deep learning methods for 3D CT image registration in lung cancer treatment.
- **Evaluating LLMs on Radiation Oncology Physics**: Assessing the performance of LLMs on specialized topics within radiation oncology physics.
- **SAMAug & Segment Anything Model for Radiation Oncology**: Innovations in model segmentation and augmentation for radiation oncology applications.
- **SAMAug: Point Prompt Augmentation for Segment Anything Model**: A novel visual point augmentation method for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that enhances interactive image segmentation performance. .
- **LLM for AAPM TG-263 Report**: Benchmarking LLMs on structuring names in compliance with AAPM TG-263.
- **Retrospective Comparative Analysis of Prostate Cancer In-Basket Messages: Responses from Closed-Domain LLM vs. Clinical Teams**: RadOnc-GPT was integrated with EHR data and evaluated on 158 in-basket message interactions. It demonstrates improved clarity and empathy in responses while saving significant time for clinical care teams and reducing healthcare costs.
- **Radiation Oncology NLP Database**: Establishing a comprehensive NLP database for radiation oncology.
